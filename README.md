### 👋 Hi, I'm Brandon Damue!

I'm a Cloud-Native Software Engineer and Team Lead with over five years of professional experience, dedicated to building and deploying products that are not just beautiful, but scalable and cost-efficient.

My core expertise is at the intersection of modern frontend architecture and reliable cloud infrastructure. I spend my days focused on the Next.js/React/TypeScript ecosystem, leading the technical direction for applications from initial design (Figma) through deployment. As a Co-Founder, I understand that engineering decisions must align directly with business goals and user needs.

The other half of my focus is on DevOps and delivery. I hold the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional certification, which means I don't just write code; I own the process of getting it securely to production. I specialize in automating everything, from CI/CD pipelines to provisioning infrastructure using Terraform (IaC).

Beyond the keyboard, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge. I’m an active AWS Community Builder in the Networking & Content Delivery space, creating tutorials to help new engineers understand complex cloud architecture. This combination of hands-on technical leadership and subject matter advocacy defines my approach: Build with excellence, and share the knowledge.
