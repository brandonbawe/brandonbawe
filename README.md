### About Me 👨🏽‍💻

I'm a full stack web development student at 7 Advanced Academy in Douala the Economic capital of Cameroon🇨🇲. I'm currently interning at 7 GPS here in Douala. I'm a curious  guy who is always open to learn, grow and expand my circle of competence in what I anything I do. In our own capacity, I try like to help people around me. Ohhh, did I tell you I love reading? Yeah I love reading self-help, science fiction, history and financial books during my free time. Recently, I found out I'm kind of like writing so I'm using this new found skill to create an online presence for myself by writing tech related articles and tutorials on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) and [hashnode.com](https://hashnode.com/). I'm looking forward to creating my own blog in a few weeks.
