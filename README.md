## About Me 👨🏽‍💻

I'm a full stack web development student at 7 Advanced Academy in Douala the Economic capital of Cameroon🇨🇲 but I'm currently an intern at 7 GPS here in Douala. I'm a curious  guy who is always open to learn, grow and expand my circle of competence in anything that I do. In my own capacity, I try  to help people around me in various areas. Ohhh, did I tell you I love reading? Yeah I love reading self-help, science fiction, history and financial books during my free time. Recently, I found out that I kind of like writing so I'm using this new found skill to create an online presence for myself by writing tech related articles and tutorials on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) and [hashnode.com](https://hashnode.com/). I'm looking forward to creating a blog of my own in a few weeks.
